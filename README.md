# SparkleDonkey

## Running / Development

There are multiple ways to run the project.
I added gradle purely as a wrapper to invoke various sub-parts and for aliasing. It can be removed if it's not something we want to use.

### Client

*Using gradle:*

* `./gradlew client`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

*Using ember directly:*

* `cd client; ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
